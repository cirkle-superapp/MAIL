# Worklog — Zmail (Gmail-like mail platform)

Project: A Gmail-like email platform (mails only) built with Next.js 16 + Prisma + shadcn/ui.

Task ID: 1
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Design DB schema (Email, Label) and create seed data + shared lib

Work Log:
- Reviewed existing project scaffold (Next.js 16, TS, Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui, Prisma SQLite).
- Authored `prisma/schema.prisma` with `Email` model (threadId, from/to/cc/bcc, subject, body, snippet, date, isRead/isStarred/isImportant, folder, labels, attachment fields) and `Label` model.
- Created `src/lib/types.ts` (Folder, Email, Label, ComposeEmailInput, color maps).
- Created `src/lib/email-utils.ts` (initials, avatar color, date formatting via date-fns, snippet/html helpers).
- Created `src/store/mail-store.ts` (Zustand store for folder/label/search/selection/compose).
- Created `src/components/providers/theme-provider.tsx` (next-themes wrapper).
- Created `src/lib/seed-data.ts` with realistic inbox/sent/drafts/spam/trash emails across labels (Work, Personal, Finance, Newsletter, Travel, Social).

Stage Summary:
- DB schema finalized. Ready for `prisma db push`.
- Shared types and helpers available for both API and frontend.
- Seed data covers all folders and most labels for a realistic demo.

Task ID: 2-11
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Build API + frontend + wire up + seed + lint + self-verify

Work Log:
- Built API routes: `src/app/api/emails/route.ts` (GET list with folder/label/starred/important/search filters, POST compose, PATCH bulk), `src/app/api/emails/[id]/route.ts` (GET with thread, PATCH single, DELETE permanent, PUT reply), `src/app/api/emails/stats/route.ts` (folder/label counts), `src/app/api/labels/route.ts` + `[id]/route.ts`.
- Ran `prisma db push` to sync schema; seeded DB via `POST /api/emails {action:seed}` — 20 sample emails across INBOX/SENT/DRAFTS/SPAM/TRASH + 6 labels.
- Built data hooks (`src/hooks/use-mail.ts`) using TanStack Query + Zustand store selectors.
- Added `src/components/providers/react-query-provider.tsx` and wrapped page.
- Built frontend components: `top-bar.tsx` (logo, debounced search, refresh, settings, theme toggle, avatar), `sidebar.tsx` (rose Compose button, folder nav with unread/count badges, collapsible Labels section with colored dots, create-label dialog), `email-list.tsx` (select-all, bulk toolbar with archive/mark read/delete, skeleton + empty states), `email-row.tsx` (checkbox, star, avatar with stable hash color, unread bold, important dot, label chips, attachment + time), `email-detail.tsx` (action toolbar, thread view with collapse, rendered HTML body, attachment chip, reply/forward buttons), `compose-dialog.tsx` (Gmail-style floating window with minimize/maximize/close, To/Cc/Bcc, subject, body, attachment, send/discard), `star-button.tsx` (optimistic star toggle), `theme-toggle.tsx` (light/dark/system), `mail-app.tsx` (responsive 3-col shell, mobile list/detail swap, collapsible sidebar).
- Updated `layout.tsx` (ThemeProvider + Zmail metadata) and `page.tsx` (renders MailApp under ReactQueryProvider).

Verification (agent-browser):
- Initial render hit two bugs, both fixed:
  1. `Label` export missing from lucide-react → renamed import to `Tag as TagIcon`.
  2. Zustand selector returning a fresh object each render → infinite loop ("Maximum update depth exceeded"); switched to selecting primitives individually.
- After fixes, fresh reload produces NO console/page errors.
- Verified interactions end-to-end:
  * Inbox renders 13 emails with avatars, stars, important dots, label chips, attachments, relative times.
  * Sidebar shows unread counts (Inbox 3) + folder counts + label counts.
  * Clicking an email opens the reading pane (subject h1, sender, to/cc, rendered body, reply/forward).
  * Compose button opens floating window; filled To/Subject/Body → Send → toast "Message sent", Sent count 3→4, email appears in Sent folder.
  * Folder navigation (Inbox/Starred/Sent) all work.
  * Search "invoice" → heading "Results for invoice", results filtered 13→2.
  * Theme toggle → dark mode applied (document.documentElement.classList `dark` = true).
  * Star toggle → Starred count 4→5, button flips Star↔Unstar (persisted via PATCH).
  * Mobile (375×812): sidebar collapses to 0 width, email list full width; clicking an email hides list and shows detail full-screen with Back button.
- `bun run lint` passes clean (0 errors, 0 warnings).

Stage Summary:
- A complete Gmail-like mail platform ("Zmail") is live at `/` on port 3000.
- Stack: Next.js 16 + Prisma/SQLite + shadcn/ui + TanStack Query + Zustand + next-themes.
- All core mail flows working: read, compose, reply, star, archive, delete, search, folders, labels, bulk actions, dark mode, responsive.
